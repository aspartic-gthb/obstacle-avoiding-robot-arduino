# Troubleshooting and Debugging Log

This document records the issues encountered during the development of the Arduino-based Obstacle Avoiding Robot Car and the steps taken to resolve them.

The purpose of this file is to document the debugging process and improvements made throughout the project.

---

## Initial Problem

### Observation
- Robot showed no movement.
- Motors did not rotate even though all wiring connections were correct.
- Arduino and motor driver were powered ON.

---

## Step 1: Wiring Verification
### Actions Taken
- Rechecked all connections between Arduino, motor driver, motors, and sensors.
- Verified motor driver input and output connections.
- Ensured common ground between Arduino and motor driver.

### Result
No motor movement observed.

---

## Step 2: Motor and Driver Testing
### Actions Taken
- Tested motors independently using direct battery connection.
- Verified motor driver enable pins and control signals.
- Ran basic motor test code from Arduino.

### Result
Motors and driver appeared functional, but movement was still inconsistent.

---

## Step 3: Power Supply Investigation (Root Cause)

### Observation
- Battery voltage was low due to insufficient charge.
- Motor driver was not receiving adequate power to drive the motors.

### Actions Taken
- Fully charged the 18650 battery pack.
- Reconnected the power supply and tested the system again.

### Result
- Motors started rotating normally.
- Basic movement was achieved.

## Step 4: Code Optimization

After resolving the power issue:

### Changes Made
- Adjusted motor control logic for smoother movement.
- Tuned delay values and distance thresholds.
- Improved turning behavior and obstacle response.

### Result
- Stable forward movement achieved.
- Obstacle detection and avoidance working reliably.

---

## Current Status

- Robot functioning as intended in most scenarios.
- Overall functionality: approximately **85–90% complete**.
- Minor improvements and optimization are ongoing.

---

## Remaining Improvements

- Improve turning accuracy.
- Reduce response delay.
- Optimize code structure.
- Enhance reliability under continuous operation.

---

## Key Learning

This project highlighted the importance of:
- Checking power supply before advanced debugging
- Testing components individually
- Following a systematic troubleshooting approach
- Understanding real-world hardware limitations
